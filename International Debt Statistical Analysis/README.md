# International Debt Statistical Analysis

Welcome to the International Debt Statistical Analysis project, where I've utilized SQL to analyze how nations borrow from the World Bank, akin to individuals seeking bank loans for growth. The project involves cleaning and analyzing loan data using SQL queries, calculating debt ratios, and exploring economic correlations.

## Project Highlights
- Utilized SQL to clean and analyze loan data, uncovering borrowing patterns and potential economic insights.
- Explored correlations between borrowing behavior and economic factors, providing a comprehensive analysis of debt trends.
- Showcased practical SQL data analysis skills and the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from complex financial data.

Feel free to explore the analysis and gain insights into international borrowing patterns and their economic implications. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
