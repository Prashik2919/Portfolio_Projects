# Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System

This project utilizes the power of face recognition technology to create a real-time attendance system. The system is built using Python and various libraries, including OpenCV and face_recognition. 

## Key Features

- **Real-time Face Recognition:** The system can recognize faces in real-time using the webcam feed.
- **Attendance Marking:** Once a recognized face is detected, the system automatically marks the attendance and logs the time.
- **Efficient Encoding:** The system encodes the facial features of individuals to facilitate accurate recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

## How It Works

1. The system first captures and encodes the facial features of individuals from a set of pre-defined images.
2. It then continuously processes the video feed from the webcam, detecting and recognizing faces in real-time.
3. When a recognized face is detected, the system marks the attendance by logging the time.

This project can be applied in various settings where an automated attendance system is needed, such as classrooms, offices, or any other institution requiring efficient attendance management.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- numpy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Add the images of individuals to the 'ImagesAttendance' folder.
4. Run the script, and the system will start recognizing faces and marking attendance in real-time.
